    "## 10.1 Search Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "A search algorithm is a method for finding an item or group of items with specific properties within a collection of items. We refer to the collection of items as a <b>search space</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "The search space might be something concrete, such as a set of electronic medical records, or something abstract, such as the set of all integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will examine two algorithms for searching a list. \n",
    "Each meets the specification:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def search(L, e):\n",
    "\"\"\"Assumes L is a list.\n",
    "   Returns True if e is in L and False otherwise\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "The astute reader might wonder if this is not semantically equivalent to the Python expression\n",
    "```python\n",
    "e in L\n",
    "``` \n",
    "The answer is yes, it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "And if one is unconcerned about the efficiency of discovering whether e is in L, one should simply write that expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.1.1 Linear Search and Using Indirection to Access Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses the following algorithm to determine if an element is in a list\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def search(L, e):\n",
    "    for i in range(len(L)): # O(len(L))\n",
    "        if L[i] == e:\n",
    "            return True\n",
    "   return False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the element e is not in the list the algorithm will perform <b>O(len(L))</b> tests, i.e., the complexity is <b>at best linear</b> in the length of L.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why “at best” linear? It will be linear only if each operation inside the loop can be done in <b>constant time</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start by considering the simple case where each element of the list is an integer.\n",
    "In this case the address in memory of the ith element of the list is simply <b>start + 4i</b>, where start is the address of the start of the list. Therefore we can assume that Python could compute the address of\n",
    "the ith element of a list of integers in constant time\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a list is represented as a length (the number of objects in the list) and a sequence of fixed-size pointers to objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Figure illustrates the use of these pointers. The shaded region represents a list containing four elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The leftmost shaded box</b> contains a pointer to an integer indicating the length of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Each of the other shaded boxes</b> contains a pointer to an object in thelist.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/10.1.1.PNG\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the length field is four units of memory, and each pointer (address) occupies four units of memory, the address of the ith element of the list is stored at the address <b>start + 4 + 4i</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "this address can be found in constant time, and then the value stored at that address can be used to access the ith element. This access too is a constant-time operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates one of the most important implementation techniques  used in computing: <b>indirection</b>.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Indirection\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, indirection involves accessing something by first accessing something else that contains <b>a reference</b> to the thing initially sought.\n"
