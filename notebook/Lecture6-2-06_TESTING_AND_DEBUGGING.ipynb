Suppose, for example, that you have discovered that the bug is the result of having accidentally `mutated a list`. You could circumvent the problem locally, perhaps by making a copy of the list. Alternatively, you could consider `using a tuple instead of a list` (since tuples are immutable), perhaps eliminating imilar bugs elsewhere in the code.\n",
