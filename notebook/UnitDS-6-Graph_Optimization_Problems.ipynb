    "\n",
    "As far as running time is concerned, the behavior of two commonly used graph operations illustrates the difference in computational efficiency between the adjacency matrix and the adjacency list. \n",
    "\n",
    "These operations are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determine whether or not there is an **edge** between two given vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find `all the vertices adjacent` to a given vertex\n",
    "\n",
    "**Determine whether or not there is an `edge` between two given vertices.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjacency matrix supports the first operation in **constant time** because it requires just an **index** operation into a two-dimensional array. \n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, the linked adjacency list requires an index into `an array of linked lists` and then a search of a linked list for a target vertex. \n",
    "\n",
    "The running time is `linear with the length of this list`, on the average. The use of an array-based adjacency list can improve this performance to **logarithmic time**, if the vertices can be sorted in the lists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Find `all the vertices adjacent` to a given vertex**\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjacency list tends to support finding `all the vertices` adjacent to a given vertex more efficiently than the adjacency matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the adjacency list, the set of adjacent vertices for a given vertex is simply the list for that vertex, which can be located with one index operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the set of adjacent vertices for a given vertex in the adjacency matrix must be computed by traversing that vertex’s row in the matrix and accumulating just those positions that contain $1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The operation must always visit $N$ cells in the adjacency matrix, whereas the operation typically visits much fewer than $N$ nodes in an adjacency list. \n",
    "\n",
    "The limiting case is that of a complete graph. In this case, each cell in the matrix is occupied by $1$, each linked list has $N–1$ nodes, and the performance is a toss-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linked adjacency list and the array-based adjacency list exhibit performance **trade-offs** for `insertions` of edges into the lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The array-based insertion takes linear time, whereas the linked-based insertion requires constant time. \n",
    " \n",
    "#### 2.2.4 memory  \n",
    "\n",
    "As far as memory usage is concerned, the adjacency matrix always requires $N^2$ cells, no matter how many edges connect the vertices. Thus, the only case in which no cells are wasted is that of a complete graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the adjacency list requires an array of $N$ pointers and a number of nodes equal to twice the number of edges in the case of an undirected graph. The number of edges typically is much smaller than $N^2$, although as the number of edges increases, the extra memory required for the pointers in the linked adjacency list becomes a significant factor."
