    "\n",
    "Python is a <b style=\"color:red\">living</b> language. Since its introduction by <b style=\"color:blue\">Guido von Rossum in 1990</b>, it has undergone many changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the first decade of its life, Python was a little known and little used language. That changed with the arrival of  <b style=\"color:blue\">Python 2.0 in 2000</b>. In addition to incorporating a number of important improvements to the language itself, it marked a shift in the evolutionary path of the language. `A large number of people began developing libraries` that interfaced seamlessly with Python, and continuing support and development of the <b style=\"color:blue\">Python ecosystem became a community-based activity</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b style=\"color:blue\">Python 3.0 was released at the end of 2008</b>. This version of Python cleaned up many of the\n",
    "inconsistencies in the design of the various releases of Python 2 (often referred to as Python 2.x). However, it was <b style=\"color:blue\">not backward compatible</b>. That meant that most programs written for earlier versions of Python could not be run using implementations of Python 3.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use <b style=\"color:blue\">Python 3</b> throughout this course.\n",

    "> Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and **dynamic typing**, together with its **interpreted** nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\n",
