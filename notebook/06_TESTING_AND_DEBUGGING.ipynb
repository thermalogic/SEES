    "<h3> Version control</h3> \n",
    "A component of software configuration management, version control, also known as revision control or source control,is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the \"revision number,\" \"revision level,\" or simply \"revision.\" For example, an initial set of files is \"revision 1.\" When the first change is made, the resulting set is \"revision 2,\" and so on. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The need for a logical way to organize and control revisions has existed for almost as long as writing has existed, but revision control became much more important, and complicated, when the era of computing began. The numbering of book editions and of specification revisions are examples that date back to the print-only era. Today, the most capable (as well as complex) revision control systems are those used in software development, where a team of people may change the same files.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>GIT</h3>\n",
    "Git is a widely used version control system for software development.[5] It is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed,[6] data integrity,[7] and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.[8] Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server.[9] Like the Linux kernel, Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>GITHUB</h3>\n",
    "GitHubGitHub is a website where you can upload a copy of your Git repository. It is a Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration. It also provides access control and several collaboration features such as wikis, task management, and bug tracking and feature that can be helpful for projects. It allows you to collaborate with other people on a project. It does that by providing a centralized location to share the repository, a web-based interface to view it, and features like forking, pull requests distributed revision control, issues, and wikis.\n",
