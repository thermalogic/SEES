# Foundamentals and Practice of Software Engineering with Python

* If you have concerns about the course, please email to me or open [the github issue](https://github.com/PySEE/home/issues). I value all suggestions.
 
    * Email: cmh@seu.edu.cn. 

## Goal

This course is intended to train **students majored in thermal energy engineering** in good software skills for producing code.

We will cover: 

* writing clean, testable, high quality code in Python
* interactive analysis and literate programming with the IPython Notebook
* a useful set of algorithmic and problem reduction techniques
* computational tools to model and understand data(numpy, matplotlib, scipy)
* debug programs using a standardized approach
* write unit tests and evaluate software quality
* use version control 
* C/C++ progamming with GCC

### Required Materials and Textbooks

* A laptop computer will be needed in the classroom.

# Update Course

This repository contain all files of the course. You can manually download these files, 

![down](./guide/img/downloadhome.jpg)

but we recommend that you use [git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases) to **clone** and **update** this repository.

If you have installed [git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases), you can use any GUI git client to update this repository, for example: [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

You may also use the following **commands:**

### Cloning to Your Computer

When you clone a repository you set up a copy on your computer. Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PySEE/home.git
```

This will create a folder **home** on your computer, with the files in subdirectories.

### Updating to The Latest Version

As we release new files, or if we update an already released files, you'll have to update your repository.

You can do this by changing into the **home** directory and executing:

```bash
git pull
```
That's it - you'll have the latest version of the repository.

## TIPS

We highly recommend you practice coding whenever you have a few minutes.

Even if you are just modifying available code, it will be incredibly beneficial.

You **NEED** to **get your hands dirty** and **practice**
